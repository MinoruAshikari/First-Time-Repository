# First Time Repository

This is my first GitHub repository created from my MacBook Air.

I am learning **Git, GitHub, Python, AI tools, and English** to work remotely for global companies as a creative and technical professional.

## About Me

- **Name:** Minoru Ashikari (焚き火社長)
- **Location:** Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
- **Background:** SNS Director, content creator, podcast host, and video editor
- **Current Focus:** Python, Git, AI tools (LLMs), and English (C1 level)

My goal is to combine **content creation, marketing, and AI / programming** to build scalable systems and work as a remote professional with an annual income of 10M JPY or more.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. `intro.py`

A simple Python script that prints my basic profile and goals.

**Tech used:**

- Python 3

**What it does:**

- Prints my name, nickname, location, roles, and main career goal.
- Serves as my first Python script in this learning journey.

You can run it with:

```bash
python3 intro.py
```

## Future Plans

I will gradually add more small projects such as:

- A script to generate article titles and outlines for note  
- Tools to generate SNS captions for X / Instagram  
- Simple AI-assisted scripts using OpenAI API  
- Utilities for English learning and text processing  

This repository will become part of my **public portfolio** to show my growth in programming and AI.
